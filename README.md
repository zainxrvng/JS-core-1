### 3 things that I found weird about javascript

1) That arrow functions have limitations when we use this property in them but normal funtions dont have that issue

2) ternary operators can be used inside template literals

3) I did not know about Implicit and Explicit Return  and array can be indirctly modified even if it has a const on it
